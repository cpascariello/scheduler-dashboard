## Open Items

### 2026-03-11 - Wallet identity hub (User Command Center evolution)
**Source:** Wallet view brainstorming
**Description:** Expand the wallet view beyond ops/debugging into a richer identity hub: wallet balance, ALEPH staking, transaction history, etc. Part of a broader evolution from an ops dashboard to a User Command Center. Build on top of the Phase 1 ops-focused wallet view.
**Priority:** Low

### 2026-03-06 - Remove tooltip from hash in Latest VMs card
**Source:** User request
**Description:** On the overview page's Latest VMs card, the hash column shows a tooltip on hover (from `CopyableText`). Remove the tooltip — the hash is already visible and the tooltip adds noise in this compact card context.
**Priority:** Low


### 2026-03-05 - Mobile-responsive filter UI
**Source:** Identified while brainstorming list page filtering overhaul
**Description:** Adapt the new filter bar (search, collapsible filters, status pills with count badges) for mobile viewports. Desktop version comes first; mobile adaptation deferred.
**Priority:** Medium

### 2026-03-04 - Stats sparklines via client-side accumulation
**Source:** Identified while working on real API migration (Decision #14)
**Description:** The API has no `/stats/history` endpoint. Sparklines were removed during migration. Could accumulate stats snapshots client-side in React Query cache (or a simple in-memory ring buffer) to rebuild 24h trend data. Better solution: request a `/stats/history` endpoint from the backend team.
**Priority:** Medium

### 2026-03-01 - WebSocket migration
**Source:** Design doc
**Description:** Replace polling with WebSocket connections for real-time event streaming. Would reduce latency and server load compared to 10-30s polling intervals.
**Priority:** Medium

### 2026-03-01 - Sidebar component in DS
**Source:** App shell implementation
**Description:** The AppSidebar is currently a local component. If other Aleph projects need similar navigation, consider promoting it to the DS with configurable nav items.
**Priority:** Low

### 2026-03-01 - E2E tests
**Source:** Implementation plan
**Description:** Add Playwright E2E tests for critical user flows: navigate pages, filter tables, open detail panels, toggle theme.
**Priority:** Medium

### 2026-03-01 - Resource usage charts
**Source:** Design doc
**Description:** Add time-series charts for CPU/memory/disk usage history on node detail views. Recharts was removed during API migration — would need to re-add or use a lighter charting library.
**Priority:** Medium


---

## Paused (waiting on backend)

### 2026-03-09 - Server-side search
**Source:** API pagination migration analysis
**Description:** Push search to API instead of client-side filtering. Would replace `textSearch()` in `filters.ts` with a `?search=` query param. Already have `useDebounce` hook ready.
**Blocked on:** Olivier adding search query params to v1 list endpoints

### 2026-03-09 - Expanded `/stats` endpoint
**Source:** API pagination migration analysis
**Description:** Request per-status breakdowns in `/stats` response (unreachable/unknown/removed nodes, scheduled/orphaned/missing/unschedulable VMs). Currently `getOverviewStats()` fetches all nodes + all VMs just to count by status — wasteful and won't scale.
**Blocked on:** Backend change from Olivier

## Investigate

### 2026-03-09 - Node map / geo view
**Description:** Visualize node locations on a map. Feasibility depends on whether IPv6 or address fields can be geolocated.

### 2026-03-09 - Allocation timeline
**Description:** Visual timeline of VM migrations using history data. Show scheduled/migrated events per VM as a timeline component.

### 2026-03-09 - Health trends dashboard
**Description:** Track node health transitions over time, show uptime percentage per node. Likely needs a backend `/stats/history` or `/nodes/:hash/health` endpoint.

### 2026-03-09 - Resource capacity planning
**Description:** Cluster-wide utilization view — aggregate vCPU/memory/disk across all nodes, show remaining headroom. Data already available from node resources.

### 2026-03-09 - Alerts / anomaly indicators
**Description:** Flag nodes losing VMs or going unreachable frequently. Client-side heuristic from history data — detect patterns like repeated status changes.

### 2026-03-09 - Aleph Cloud hosting architecture research
**Description:** The current static export + client-side polling model won't scale long-term (fetching all pages on every poll, no persistent state, no indexing). Research how to run a proper frontend + backend on Aleph Cloud. Key questions: Can we run a backend VM on Aleph that indexes scheduler data and serves it via API? Can we use Aleph messages (STORE, AGGREGATE, POST) to persist historical snapshots, user preferences, or pre-computed stats? What's the deployment model — VM instance for the backend, static IPFS for the frontend, or both on a single instance? Look at existing Aleph Cloud apps (explorer, account) for patterns. Also consider filter state persistence as part of this — advanced filters (e.g. Has GPU) are lost on navigation because they live in React state, not URL params. The right solution depends on the architecture: URL params for static, server-side filter state or proper routing for a backend model.

### 2026-03-10 - ~~Authorization reverse-index indexer~~ → Integrated via api2 endpoints
**Source:** Wallet view research (2026-03-10)
**Description:** ~~Build a backend indexer for reverse permission lookups.~~ Integrated using api2's existing `/api/v0/authorizations/granted/` and `/api/v0/authorizations/received/` endpoints in the wallet view. If Olivier's CCN endpoint offers additional data, can enhance later.

### 2026-03-09 - Bookmarkable filter URLs
**Description:** Write active filters back to URL search params (currently read-once on mount). Enables sharing filtered views via URL.

## Completed / Rejected

<summary>Archived items</summary>

- ✅ 2026-03-02 - Align DS color tokens with Tailwind conventions — resolved by Decision #11 (dashboard uses `--color-error-*` tokens directly)
